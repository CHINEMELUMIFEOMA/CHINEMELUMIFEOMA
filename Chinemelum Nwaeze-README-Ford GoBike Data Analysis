# (Ford GoBike Bike Share Data Analyis)
## by Chinemelum Nwaeze


## Dataset

>The dataset consist of over 180,000 records of cyclers data containing data like
duration_sec, start_time, end_time, start_station_id,start_station_name among others.
In the course of my analysis, I dropped off rows and columns not needed for my analyis
leaving me with over 165,000 rows and 7 columns.


## Summary of Findings

> The analysis has just two of the variables numeric with very weak positive correlation.
From my analysis, In accordance with my initial expectation, there were more male than female
in the data, though the reason for this was not captured in the data, I had expected it to be
as a result of the strenous nature of cycling. 

>On the average more female though in a very minute degree rode bike for a longer period of time than male.

>Analysis also showed that there is a concentration of bikers in certain areas like the 
San Francisco Caltrain Station 2 (Townsend St at 4th St),Market St at 10th St,
Montgomery St BART Station (Market St at 2nd St) as they appear in the top 5 analysis both start and end station.

>The bike share for all trip program was strictly for the subscribers and surprisingly 
less than 20% of the subscribers partook in it


## Key Insights for Presentation

>For the presentation, I am looking to showcasing the gender and  the age variables as they affect the time 
spent cycling. I would be making use of the violinplot and boxplot for this presentation. 
I would ensure proper labellinng for clarity and comprehension ease
